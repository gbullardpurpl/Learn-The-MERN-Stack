Just watch and enjoy.

### P2 Express API & MongoDB

IMPORTANT!!! During P2 make sure to add config/\* to your .gitignore before digging into the video so your MongoDB URI user/pass combo is not visible if you have this repo set to public.

MongoDB is now on port 3500 not 5000 as stated in mLab db section.

### Developer Notes

- The project allows for easy migration from server to server and install dependencies, or when someone clones your repo, by untilizing ( cli: 'npm run client-install' ) after file migration.
- The project allows for server and client sides to be run concurrently on development/localhost by untilizing ( cli: 'npm run dev' ).
